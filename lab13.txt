Exercise 13.1

a. With React Router we can now have multiple pages in our single-page app, increasing the number
   of features we are able to add.

b. browserHistory is better; hashHistory includes a "#" in your URL, which is pretty unsightly. Browsers
   also don't send the # part of the URL in any of the HTTP requests when using hasHistory, so the
   server wouldn't know what the # in the URL is hen a user is trying to request a page.

c. When using browserHistory, server.js has to be modified to handle the URLs that will be requested
   by the user, including sending all non-root requests to the specified path (/dist). It will also
   map the main app to that path.

Exercise 13.2

a. CommentEdit maintains the author and text state, while CommentBox maintains the whole array of
   comments in the database.

b. When the AJAX PUT and DELETE methods return successfully, CommentEdit goes back to the root route,
   displaying the updated list of comments. It's not different from what the "Cancel" button does;
   both returns the user back to the root page.

c. Link is different from a HTML hyperlink in that instead of refreshing the page to go to the
   desired route, it navigates to the new URL and renders the component of that URL, so the page
   doesn't have to refresh.
