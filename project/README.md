CS 336: Web Development
Final Project Vision

As a committee member of Calvin’s Women in Computing club, I want to create a website for our club where people can go to find information about us, upcoming events, opportunities to apply for, and connect with other tech women in Calvin or in the industry. It would also ideally be a platform for women to talk about their experiences in internships, jobs, other work experiences through blog posts. Right now, we’re relying solely on our mailing list to communicate with our club members, so a website would make our club more official, and might also make it easier to get external funding and become part of a student chapter in the future.

Preferred team members: Kelly Oh, Kwabena Agyei Boahene, Adrianna Williams
