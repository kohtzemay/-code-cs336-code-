    <b>Exercise 3.1</b>
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>Express.js is a framework based off Node.js, while Node.js is a platform for building these server-side. In other words, you can't use Express without Node, but you can use Node without Express.</li>
      <li>The package.json file is basically a JSON file that keeps track of all the packages (and their respective details) and scripts being used for your application -- the metadata of the application. It provides information to NPM.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <b>Exercise 3.2</b>
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>Static files are files that will not be changed or updated. The content in these files are what is what is displayed to the user.</li>
      <li>Yes, it still is -- as long as the correct route is being hit, the message will be served up, but not displayed, because it's being overwritten by the HTML page.</li>
    </ul>
