Exercise 11.1

a. The production deployment does a bit more to the code that's deployed than the development version does. For
   example, it uglifies the code, meaning that it makes the source code pretty much unreadable, which also reduces
   the app size, since in production the developer shouldn't have to touch the code anymore, assuming that the code
   has been fully tested for bugs and other issues. On the other hand, the development deployment has the hot
   reloader which is useful for debugging and making changes to the code for testing.

b. Occurence order: Webpack uses this plugin to optimize the app by prioritizing the modules that get used the most
   and giving them the smallest ids, so that they are loaded first.
   Uglification: Uglifies the code and compresses it, reducing the size of the app.
   Text extraction: This moves all the imported CSS files to a separate CSS output file, so that styles aren't
   inlined in our JS code

Exercise 11.2

a. Deploying with Heroku provides an actual domain that people can go to and view, so they don't need to have the
   code downloaded on their machines in order to run the app. Heroku also comes with auto-deployment, so if we
   enable that then once our code is ready for production, all we would need to do is push it to the production
   branch and Heroku will handle the rest.

b. Heroku reads the package.json file in order to know how to build our application and create an executable. Then
   it looks at the main field in our package.json to see what has to be run. And to deploy, Heroku creates a new Git
   branch that's associated with our Git repository, so when we do a "git push," what Heroku actually does is push
   to the branch it created.
